# UNI-OS

UNI-OS is a hybrid, Linux-like operating system that can run `.EXE` and `.APK` files by converting them into portable `.bin` executables and executing them through `.run` launchers. It uses Linux APIs and compatibility layers, including Wine and an Android runtime emulator. UNI-OS includes native Linux desktop environments such as KDE and supports spoofed kernel compatibility for advanced anti-cheat systems.
