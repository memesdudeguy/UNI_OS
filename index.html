<p>This is Ingram Swimley. I'm a proud owner of a future OS, UNI_OS an open source operating system designed to be lightweight, and backwards compatible with Linux, Windows, and Android applications. We strive to let anyone use our operating system. Even if you're a beginner, and you just use simple Windows. Maybe you used other operating systems before, but nothing was good enough to use. Well this is an operating system that could replace every desktop environment. Making this operating system great for personal or business use.
	 It has a sleek GUI too. It also has hardware requirements that are very low. Making old computers run on modern software. This will support dedicated graphics cards such as Intel, Nvidia, and AMD, but beta releases will first only support AMD, and Nvidia GPUS. (keep in mind we are not affiliated with Valve, GNU, or Microsoft) Since it’s also compatible with a Linux terminal you could game easily on UNI_OS Thanks to a  WINE (Window Is Not an Emulator) like software called Proton by Valve, and some other features like wayland.
	This is a lightweight API ment for Linux to interact with your desktop environments hardware, so you can run Windows .EXE files, and other types of applications ment for Windows so that it can run with minimum effort, rather than directX. UNI_OS will be easy to install from the github repository, and it will have a minimum GUI for the installation of the OS for people all over the globe, Making it easy to install. Keep in mind this will only work for x86 type processors for now, but someday we will aim to run this on ARM devices enabling you to run this OS on phones, tablets, and Raspberry Pi like devices.
	it’s an Android based system specifically BlissOS based while still having access to these features. We also don’t track you since we aim to have freedom and privacy. This will also limit bloatware making this OS lightweight, and all the better to use. If you want to support this OS we will have a Buy me a coffee link to donate, or in the future you can shop piratestyle.net (These are both not officially links yet). This will contain electronics and other gadgets. The price might be high, but we’ll try to make good hardware and some of the money will go into UNI_OS to keep our development going. I plan to improve, and declose the ever changing world of technology. Why have multiple tools when we can bake it into one. Hopefully in the next year it will get traction and become the next, or be the lead operating system in the 5 years.</p>
